# C++ basic road simluation (python for data visiualizion)
## for traffric congestion
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)
This is a project based on CUHK physics major 
----simulation.cpp(outdated) 
because the project dont allow any data structure,class,algothrm
due to this reason , we have to use the simplest method 
only "array and for" for creating the tasks 
- no data structure is allowed ( so no class and struct)
- no lib such as algothrm or self-writed algothrm is allowed
# files
##simulation.cpp(allowed)
the C++ simulation code which dont have any data structure and algothrm
##test.py
for creating gif to visualising the data ,parsing the xyzAn files
##xyz file (output of C++ program)
the xyz file originally is used for VMD , but since the gui is so suck , we use test.py for data visualizision
#project difficult 
since the project is not elasticity enough for us to use any data structure and algothrm,somehow its makes our task more complicated
# performance problem
> since that we dont allowed to use any data structure and algothrm , and the searching is linear , so that when the n size is large(number of cars ) it encouter slow performance
originally is used in VMD , but since the gui and the result is poor  so , we make a file "xyzAn" for the test.py to visualising the data 
# result 1 this is the first 100 secords (frames) of data
