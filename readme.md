[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joemccann/dillinger)
This is a project based on CUHK physics major 
----simulation.cpp(outdated) 
because the project dont allow any data structure,class,algothrm
due to this reason , we have to use the simplest method 
only "array and for" for creating the tasks 
- no data structure is allowed ( so no class and struct)
- no lib such as algothrm or self-writed algothrm is allowed
----test.py 
for creating gif to visualising the data 
---xyz file 
originally is used in VMD , but since the gui and the result is poor  so , we make a file "xyzAn" for the test.py to visualising the data 
# result 
this is the first 100 secords (frames) of data 

this is the first 1000 secrods (frames) of data
